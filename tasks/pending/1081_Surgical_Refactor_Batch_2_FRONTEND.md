# Task 1081: Surgical Refactor Batch 2 FRONTEND

## Objective
### 📚 Complexity Legend
* **Nesting:** Nesting depth penalty (Weight: 0.15).
* **Density:** Logic density (branching/loops) (Weight: 1.00).
* **Deps:** External dependency pressure.

### 🎯 General Instruction
Reduce the complexity variables for the following files to reach a Drag factor below 2.00. 
You have full architectural autonomy on how to split, extract, or simplify the code to achieve this goal while maintaining logic integrity.
